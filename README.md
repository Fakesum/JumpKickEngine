# JumpKickEngine

To Jump Start a Channel in the Eyes of the youtube algorithm.

## Inner Workings
This will give your videos of choice non-sticky views. These are not REAL Views, As They will slowly get auto removed 
by youtube as they are designed to do. while leaving a very small amount of views that youtube will consider as real.
Which will be witled down slowly over time.

this will make youtube think that this video is somewhat blowing up. this is will in tern cause it to temporaraily
prioritize the videos much higher than it should. This will intern cause an explosion of REAL views from youtube
showing the video/videos to everyone propotional to the amount of views given by the bot.
